# Deck-Draw
Part of the RPG Card Game MVPs, MVP #2. Main addition is drawing a card from the deck and putting it to hand.

## Demonstration
You have a list of cards in the deck, ranging from 1 to 5. The deck gets shuffled, and you draw the top 2 cards. <br> <br>

If you draw a card, you will add that to your hand, and it will tell you the remaining cards. <br> <br>

If you draw all the cards, you will have no more cards left to draw, and will be prompted to shuffle. <br> <br>

After you shuffle your hand into the deck, you can draw a new pair of hands. <br> <br>
